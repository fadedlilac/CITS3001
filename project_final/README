From directory EmilyEvan run:

javac CITS3001/*.java
java CITS3001.ThreesAI [opt] < Board/Evan.in > Board.out

The [opt] selects between strategies Beta and Mu. No option selects Beta, any option selects Mu. 
Some test information is printed to stderr, and the output file is printed to std out as per unix convention.


ABOUT:
This project was written for CITS3001 2014 by Emily Martin and Evan Benn. 
The project was to write an AI/Agent for a simplified game of threes. 
We wrote a flexible system using java, strategies and heuristics are written
seperately to the game logic to allow easy comparison and testing.
