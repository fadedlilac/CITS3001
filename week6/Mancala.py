"""
Mancala game v1.0
Lyndon While, 3 April 2014

The program prompts the user for the game size X, then it plays a
game of Mancala between two random players and creates an SVG file

    MancalaGameX.svg

that shows the history of the board during the game. Each board is
annotated with the next move made, and the final board is annotated
with the average branching factor during the game. 

Software to run the program is available from python.org. Get Python 3. 

The size of the displayed boards and the fonts used can be controlled
by changing the variable size below. 

The colours used in the display can be controlled by changing the
variable colours. 

Please report any bugs on help3001. Unless they're embarrassing ones. :-)
